That's why we use a mix of professional photography, floorplans and videos as well as active marketing through emails, property alerts and portals to help you get your home sold. Book a valuation What we provide Professional photography xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"? Video tours Digital marketing Social advertising Stand out with professional property marketing Quality photography that makes your property shine We know that property with high quality photography generates the most viewing requests and attracts the best offers. They can also help the property sell faster by attracting serious buyers early. Better photography will help your property stand out from the crowd, generating more interest and viewings. More viewings will generate more offers and subsequently help achieve a higher price We take multiple photos and merge all of the best qualities to create one final, exceptional image. Video tours really show off your home At JNP we offer property tours that show off your home in more details than photographs alone. They allow buyers to get a better idea of the property before they commit to a physical viewing. We find this means that buyers who do come to your property for a viewing are much more likely to put in an offer. Drone photography As part of our photography options we are also able to take drone images of the property footprint. This is especially beneficial for properties with a large back garden or in an unusual location. This imagery really lets potential buyers see the size of the plot as well as the terrain immediately surrounding it. We create accurate floorplans as standard After images and tours we know that the floorpan is the next thing that buyers will view. Getting a good sense of the flow and layout of a property and the size of the rooms is a big factor in choosing a property. That's why we create accurate floorplans as part of our property marketing pack. We get your property seen with excellent digital marketing Most people today will start their property search online, that's why we market your property on the UKs biggest portals as well as our own website. Once you commission us to sell your property it will be listed on our website within 48 hours. Your property will also be registered on the top property websites including Rightmove and Zoopla. We also use a combination of social media and email marketing through targeted property alerts to get your home in front of buyers. Premium listings on Rightmove and Zoopla as standard Every single property listed with JNP will have a premium listing with Rightmove and Zoopla, giving your property more pictures, a bigger listing and more detail views. On average a premium listing increases views of your property by 19%*. *Rightmove. 2019 Social media advertising for increased visibility We use a mix of social media channels to promote your property to a wider mix of customers. Utilising the channel technology we only target customers wo are interested in property in the local area with adverts on their Facebook and Instagram pages.
