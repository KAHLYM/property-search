These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W T. level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L . " — Professor McGonagall to her fifth-year class [src] Conjuring Spells were, presumably, a group of spells that resided in the branch of transfiguration known as conjuration , and were therefore used to conjure things. [1] Frog-Rabbits were mutations caused by improperly performed Conjuring Spells that were explained by the Principle of Artificianimate Quasi-Dominance . [2] Contents 1 History 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references History [ ] Professor Minerva McGonagall mentioned these spells to her fifth-year Transfiguration class in September of 1995 at Hogwarts , when introducing Vanishing Spells . [1] Behind the scenes [ ] Although it is possible this refers to a group of spells used to conjure things, it is also possible that Professor McGonagall was speaking of an individual spell when mentioning Conjuring Spells, as she also referred to the Vanishing Spell as a plural.
