The location is peaceful and leafy yet within easy walking distance of the city centre. The current owners have carried out a programme of renovations with a great deal of thought given to the layout and the quality of the interiors. The contemporary extension to the south of the building is particularly successful as it provides the house with the large open plan space that most people are looking for in a modern family home. This bright space also links the house beautifully to the garden and is flooded with natural light. The result is a smart family home which is easy to live in due to the natural flow of the accommodation. Interconnected living and entertaining spaces, combined with six double bedrooms, many with beautiful views of Arthur's Seat, make this a beautiful family home. On entering the house, there is an immediate sense of space due to the large hall which flows into a wide cloakroom area. The ground floor provides all the living and entertaining space, consisting of an impressive dining room to the front, linking through to the playroom/snug and on to the open plan kitchen/breakfast/living room. This series of rooms provide exceptional entertaining space. Also to the front of the house is a further reception room which would also work well as an office or additional bedroom. Further ground floor accommodation consists of a guest bedroom, shower room and a utility room. There is direct access from the rear hall to the garage. The magnificent principal bedroom is to the front of the house. Formerly the drawing room, this room has a high ceiling, intricate cornice work, en suite shower room and a dressing room. Also on the first floor are three further double bedrooms, a shower room and the large family bathroom. Outside, there is a large south-facing garden with a child friendly artificial lawn and a sunny patio area for outside dining. At the far end, is a specially designed barbecue area. There is direct access from the garden to the parking area to the front of the house with space for several cars. An electric car charge point has been installed. Mansionhouse Road is one of Edinburgh's most desirable addresses in a sought-after residential area on the city's Southside. There are excellent local shops, bistros and bars in Marchmont, Bruntsfield and Morningside. The city centre is a short stroll across The Meadows. The King's Theatre and Dominion Cinema are located close by. Local sporting facilities include several golf courses, the Royal Commonwealth Pool, Waverley Tennis and Sports Club and pleasant walks in the open spaces of the nearby Meadows, Hermitage of Braid and Blackford Hill. Edinburgh is well known for its excellent private and state schooling. George Watson's College, George Heriot's and Merchiston Castle School are all within comfortable reach.
