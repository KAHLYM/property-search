Drawing together wisdom from ancient Christian practices, the resources provide an invaluable way to slow down and reflect in these busy times. Each resource follows a series of key practices. You'll find them at the heart of Come and See each Lent, but the practices can be used at any time of the year. Space Makers is the version used by schools and churches in the Diocese of Oxford, and a brand new family edition will be published in spring 2023. See more below.
