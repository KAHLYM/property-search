Repeated squaring From Algorithmist (Redirected from Repeated Squaring ) Jump to navigation Jump to search Repeated squaring , or repeated doubling is an algorithm that computes integer powers of a number quickly. The general problem is to compute x y {\displaystyle x^{y}} for an arbitrary integer y. The naive method, doing y multiplications of x, is very slow. It can be sped up by repeatedly squaring x until the current power of x exceeds y, and then collecting the "useful" powers. Example [ edit ] So, which powers of x are useful? Consider the concrete example of computing 3 13 {\displaystyle 3^{13}} . The binary representation of 13 is ( 1101 ) 2 {\displaystyle {(1101)}_{2}} , so 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 {\displaystyle 8+4+1=13} . 3 1 {\displaystyle 3^{1}} 3 {\displaystyle 3} 3 2 {\displaystyle 3^{2}} 9 = 3 × 3 {\displaystyle 9=3\times 3} 3 4 {\displaystyle 3^{4}} 81 = 9 × 9 {\displaystyle 81=9\times 9} 3 8 {\displaystyle 3^{8}} 6561 = 81 × 81 {\displaystyle 6561=81\times 81} Notice that each result is the square of the previous result, and hence can be computed in one multiplication. 3 1 × 3 4 × 3 8 = 3 13 = 1594323 {\displaystyle 3^{1}\times 3^{4}\times 3^{8}=3^{13}=1594323} Analysis [ edit ] Pseudocode [ edit ] // Calculates n to the p power, where p is a positive number. func power( var n as integer, var p as integer ) if p = 0 return 1 if p = 1 return n if p is odd return n * power( n * n, (p-1) / 2 ) else return power( n * n, p / 2 ) end func It is not neccesary to keep all the powers of x in memory, only a product accumulator and the last power of x is neccesary. Note that the algorithm does only O ( lg ⁡ y ) {\displaystyle O(\lg y)} multiplications, since it has to do no more than twice as many multiplcations as the number of bits representing y. In general, we use the equation x y = ( x y d i v 2 ) 2 ⋅ x y mod 2 {\displaystyle x^{y}=(x^{y~{\rm {div}}~2})^{2}\cdot x^{y{\bmod {2}}}} .
