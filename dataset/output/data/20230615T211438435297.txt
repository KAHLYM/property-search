The rules for how fees will be charged for Assured Shorthold Tenancies (AST) are different to how fees will be charged for Non-Housing Act Tenancies (NHA).

You usually have an AST if: you don’t share any accommodation with your landlord and they live elsewhere the rent is less than £100,000 a year the tenant is an individual and is using the property as their main home Common Law Tenancies A tenancy would be created as a NHA if the rent is over £100,000 a year, or where it is not the tenant’s main home. Company tenancies are also NHAs. A company let is when a company takes on a residential tenancy agreement as the tenant, rather than an individual. The tenancy will be in the company name.
