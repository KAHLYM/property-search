Inequalities are useful when projecting profits and breakeven figures.

The symbols used for inequalities are <, >, ≤, ≥. \(7 \textgreater x\) reads as '7 is greater than \(x\) ' (or ' \(x\) is less than 7', reading from right to left). \(x \leq -4\) reads as ' \(x\) is less than or equal to -4' (or '-4 is greater than or equal to \(x\) ', reading from right to left). Inequalities on a number line Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥). For example, this is the number line for the inequality \(x \geq 0\) : The symbol used is greater than or equal to (≥) so a closed circle must be used at 0. \(x\) is greater than or equal to 0, so the arrow from the circle must show the numbers that are larger than 0. Example Show the inequality \(y \textless 2\) on a number line. \(y\) is less than (<) 2, which means an open circle at 2 must be used. \(y\) is less than 2, so an arrow below the values of 2 must be drawn in. Question What inequality is shown by this number line? Reveal answer There is a closed circle at -5 with the line showing the numbers that are greater than -5. This means \(-5 \leq x\) (writing the \(x\) on the right-hand side). There is also an open circle at 4, with the numbers less than 4 indicated. This means \(x \textless 4\) (writing the \(x\) on the left-hand side). The line between these two points means that \(x\) satisfies both inequalities, so a double inequality must be created. Putting \(x\) in the middle of the two inequalities gives \(-5 \leq x \textless 4\) . \(x\) is greater than or equal to -5 and \(x\) is less than 4. 1 2 3 4 Page 1 of 4 Glossary More Guides Algebraic expressions - Edexcel Algebraic formulae - Edexcel Solving linear equations - Edexcel Solving simultaneous equations - Edexcel Solving quadratic equations - Edexcel Inequalities - Edexcel Sequences - Edexcel Straight line graphs - Edexcel Other graphs - Edexcel Transformation of curves - Higher - Edexcel Algebraic fractions - Edexcel Using and interpreting graphs - Edexcel Struggling to get your head round revision or exams?
