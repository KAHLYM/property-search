The purchasing process is slightly different from others houses, however, so we’ve created a handy guide to help you know what to expect. Pick a location There are new build developments all across the UK, so you will have lots of location options. Do your research and contact your local branch for help finding the perfect one for you. Find an open day New developments will often have open days that come with an incentive, such as help with moving costs, paid stamp duty, or part-funding a deposit. These incentives can help make moving even easier for you so make sure to ask the sales consultant. Visit the show home Even if the development isn’t fully built yet, you should be able to see a show home that will be very similar to your finished property. When you visit your consultant they will be able to advise on anything that doesn’t come as standard. This is a great chance to get a feel for the property, and it’s worth going to a walk around the rest of the development as well. Fixtures and fittings Depending on the development you’ve chosen and how far along building work is, you may be able to choose finishes such as kitchen tiles, work tops and flooring options. You will need to reserve your home early and double check with the developers regarding this. Place your deposit Once you’ve decided your plot, the sales consultant will request a deposit, which will vary in amount from developer-to-developer. Once you’ve paid up the property will be taken off the market and you’ll be advised of the estimated completion date. The consultant will provide you with updates throughout the process and consult you on any changes to fixtures and fittings. Check your guarantee New build properties come with guarantee covers which can vary from 5 to 10 years. Make sure to check with your consultant how long it is for your home.
