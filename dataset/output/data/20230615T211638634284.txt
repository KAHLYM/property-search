Frequently asked questions Whatâ€™s the benefit of an online valuation? The online valuation tool will give you a quick estimated value of your property. This is based on what properties like yours have sold or let for recently. It will never be as accurate as getting an agent to visit the property, who has expert knowledge of that area, but is good step to finding out what your house could be sold or let for. What is an online valuation based on? The valuation is generated automatically using Land Registry data and property listings data. It doesn't take into account any developments made to a property so may not include any additional bedrooms or features such as an outside office or an en-suite that you may have added. To get a more accurate valuation, we always recommend booking in with an estate agent. Is there a cost for an accurate valuation? At JNP we offer property valuations free of charge. There will be a fee to sell your property, but that is only paid once the sale completes - so you can be sure we're working on your sale all through the process.
