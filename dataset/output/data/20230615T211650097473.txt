Functional Active Inactive Analytical Active Inactive Non-essential Active Inactive Manage Accept Our history The first JNP branch was opened in High Wycombe in 1994. Today JNP is an award winning estate agent with 4 local offices, helping you buy, sell, let and rent across South Buckinghamshire As a company we have grown over the years, but our passion for property and our core principle of excellent customer service remains the same as the day we started in 1994. First beginnings - High Wycombe In January 1994 we opened the doors to our sales office in Crendon Street, High Wycombe as the JNP partnership. Today, our High Wycombe offices provide the biggest team of property experts in the area and is home to our Property Management team and Land & New Homes division alongside our Residential Sales and Lettings Teams. Branching out - Hazlemere Our Hazlemere branch opened in April 1994 in a prominent position on the village crossroads and over the years has expanded to cover Great Missenden. This enabled the business to provide a service to a wider area. Expending to Prices Risborough The Princes Risborough branch followed some years later opening its office in the High Street before outgrowing the premises and relocating to No 1 Market Square. The Princes Risborough office incorporates our Fine & Country department which specialises in the sale of prestigious properties across South Buckinghamshire. Hydegate and JNP merger The acquisition of Hydegate Estates in 2019 allowed JNP to expand into Amersham and the surrounding villages for both sales and lettings.
