The competitiveness of the rental market often combined with a tight time frame in which to find a property can make for a strenuous endeavour. We've collected some tips and tricks for viewing rental properties that should hopefully make the process a bit easier for you.

So that you don't miss out try to be the first to view and make sure you have the cost of administration fees ready in your account. Sign up to email alerts to keep ahead. Be prepared Know exactly what is important to you in a property and be willing to compromise on some things? Have a list of questions ready for the agent and if available on the viewing the current occupier. It can be really easy to forget during the viewing itself. Don't view alone Never go alone.Take someone with you or attend the viewing with a letting agent. Safety must come first and you will have another pair of eyes to help. Know the housemates first If you are renting with others as a house share, make sure you meet all of your potential new housemates before committing. Living with others, especially if you don't know there quirky ways takes a lot of patience. It can be a lot of fun but it can also end in disaster. Know the costs If you can, request to see the utility and council tax bills so you know what to expect. Ask if anything is included in the rent? If sharing, discuss and agree how the bills are split. What’s included? If the rental property is advertised as furnished, ask exactly what is included. You want significant additional costs that you may not have budgeted for. It’s all in the details Don’t forget to look at the finer details too. It is so easy to miss the little things when you are viewing a property for the first time and are focused on the big thing.
