Extensive living and entertaining space is well balanced by seven double bedrooms. This imposing house sits centrally in its grounds with a deep front garden. The current owners have recently upgraded the driveway which provides access to the garage and parking for several cars. There is good space either side of the property, leading through to the main garden. The entertaining space is phenomenal, with up to four reception rooms on the ground floor. The drawing room and study are to the front of the house. Both are well proportioned and benefit from impressive period features such as marble fireplaces and working shutters. The large central hall and elegant staircase connect the ground floor and give an immediate impression of the scale of the house. To the rear, there is a playroom and the sitting room, which is currently used as a home gym. Both these rooms flow nicely through to the stunning kitchen/breakfast room. The kitchen itself is of a smart contemporary design with a large island unit and high-quality fixtures and fittings. Folding glass doors fill the whole back wall and flood the space with light as well as providing seamless access to the garden. A shower room and utility room complete the ground floor. The principal bedroom is on an impressive scale with a large bay window and wonderful cornicing. In addition, the first floor consists of five further bedrooms, a study, a shower room, and a family bathroom. There is a final double bedroom on the second floor as well as a large room which could work well as a games room or double bedroom. Subject to the usual planning consents, there is potential to create an additional bedroom and bathroom on this floor. Outside, there is a large private garden with mature trees and a play structure which features a zip line. There is a single garage and parking for several cars.
