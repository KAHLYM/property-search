Reduce the stress involved with selling your property by negotiating on your behalf and helping you through the tricky exchange and completion stages of the deal. How to choose an estate agent Ultimately, you should choose an estate agent that you feel comfortable dealing with and who you feel will look after your best interests as a seller. To help you make a decision, we would recommend asking prospective agents the following: How and where your property will be advertised - now's the time to make sure that your property will be advertised on Rightmove! How your property compares with similar properties already on the market in terms of price and presentation. Ask to see examples of their success in selling properties like yours. You can then see how they have priced, promoted and presented other similar properties. You'll obviously be interested in the agent's fees for selling your property, but also ask about the length of any exclusivity period (i.e. a period of time during which you cannot market your property with another estate agent) and ensure you are clear on how to serve notice should you wish to. How often you can expect feedback from the agent while your property is on the market. A good agent should help you feel informed and in control throughout the process. Talk to your agent about standing out on Rightmove Having chosen a Rightmove agent, ask your agent about making your property stand out from others on the market. A Premium Listing or Featured Property on Rightmove are great ways of creating more interest from potential buyers. For further guidance, check out our selling guides here.
