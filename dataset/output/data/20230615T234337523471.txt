Echo; and someone broke into their stable and released the horses. Gina arrives at Leni and husband Jack's home to find a search party. She also learns Leni had neglected to mention several important things in their shared diary vlog . As Sheriff Floss and Deputy Martinez leave for the night, they notice a man, who was not part of the search party, getting into a pickup truck. Gina goes to her childhood home, where her ailing elderly father Victor and wheelchair-user younger sister Claudia live, and enters the bedroom the twins used to share. A flashback shows their cancer-stricken mother, Maria, giving them charm bracelets: a lion on Leni's bracelet and a dove on Gina's, in reference to each of their polar opposite personalities, while Claudia is excluded. In the present, Gina discovers a doll missing its head and arms; she later finds an arm near a tree outside. Upset, she stays at a hotel. The next morning, Leni's horse returns with human blood on its neck. In a ravine, the search party finds another horse, shot dead and its microchip had been cut out. Jack tells Gina that Leni has occasionally disappeared; his daughter Mattie confirms this but added she has never been gone this long. Gina remembers when she and Leni ran away together after their mother's funeral. She also recalls Leni's actions during their childhood causing problems, due to mistaken identity . Gina finds two doll hands, one with Leni's charm bracelet. She sets out on her own on the outskirts of the ranch to look for Leni. She enters a cave, where the twins used to hide, to find an outfit of Leni's with a doll head. A flashback shows the twins running away from a burning church and Leni telling Gina they have to switch places. In the present, Gina finds a book she authored by the clothes, with a note inside telling her she now gets both lives but has to choose which. Flashbacks show the twins at various ages every birthday, ending with the previous year, agreeing to swap lives for one year. Gina is now actually Leni, and the missing "Leni" is, in actuality, Gina. Leni changes into her other half's clothes in the cave and purposefully gives herself a head wound. In a journal voice over, she tells Gina she has not played her true identity (Leni) in a one whole year. She returns to the farm to be greeted by "her" young daughter Matilda "Mattie." 2 "Birthday" Kat Candler Vanessa Gazy August 19, 2022 ( 2022-08-19 ) 3 "Party" Li Lu Brian Yorkey August 19, 2022 ( 2022-08-19 ) 4 "Body" Li Lu Quinton Peeples August 19, 2022 ( 2022-08-19 ) 5 "Gina" Anna Mastro Julie Hébert and Mimi Won Techentin August 19, 2022 ( 2022-08-19 ) 6 "Fire" Anna Mastro Quinton Peeples & M.
