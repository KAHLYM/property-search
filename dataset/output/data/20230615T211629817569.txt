Functional Active Inactive Analytical Active Inactive Non-essential Active Inactive Manage Accept Home Complaints Procedure Making a Complaint JNP is a member of The Property Ombudsman Scheme (TPOS) and we are committed to providing a professional service to all our clients and customers. If something goes wrong, we need you to tell us about it. This will help us improve our standards. To ensure that your interests are safeguarded we have the following complaints procedure in place. If you have a complaint, please put it in writing, including as much detail as possible. We will then respond in line with the timeframes set out below (if you feel we have not sought to address your complaints within eight weeks, you may be able to refer your complaint to the Property Ombudsman to consider without our final viewpoint on the matter). The aim of this process is to resolve all customer issues or concerns as quickly as possible. In the majority of cases we find that most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably to customers' satisfaction at branch level. Stage One – Branch Manager Complaints should, in the first instance, be directed to the Manager of the branch you have been dealing with, in writing via e-mail or written letter. We will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days of receiving it. We will then investigate your complaint. This will normally be dealt with by the office manager who will review your file and speak to the member of staff who dealt with you. A formal written outcome of our investigation will be sent to you within 15 working days from receipt of your complaint. Stage Two – Director Should the local Manager not be able to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction, you can refer the matter to the Managing Director at head office for a separate review to take place, who will respond within 15 working days from receipt with our final view point. Kane Hennessy, JNP, 27a Crendon Street, High Wycombe, HP13 6LJ Or email: admin@jnp.co.uk Stage Three – The Property Ombudsman If you still remain dissatisfied you can then contact the Property Ombudsman to request an independent review. The Property Ombudsman Ltd, Milford House, 43 – 45 Milford Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire. SP1 2BP Telephone 01722 333 306 or visit www.tpos.co.uk Please note the following: You will need to submit your complaint to The Property Ombudsman within 12 months of receiving our final viewpoint letter, including any evidence to support your case. The Property Ombudsman requires that all complaints are addressed through this in-house complaints procedure, before being submitted for an independent review.
