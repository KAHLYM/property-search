Very easy to clean too. However 5 months down the line very different results. Even though I use oils such as avocado or rapeseed with high burning points, things start to carbonise at the bottom of the pan.

It cleans with a wipe and the coating seems to be sound. The only slight issue is the inside of the base is slightly convex so any liquid tends to accumulate near the edges. In common with other makes this is a design feature, the rationale behind which escapes me. Read more Helpful Report M v. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent frying pan - finally! Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2021 Style Name: Frying Pan Size Name: 24 cm Verified Purchase I first ordered the 24cm one but that is indeed really small. I returned it without any problem and received a refund almost by return. This 27cm frying pan is lovely, the best I have had in a long time. It has a very very smooth inside - need to get used to that as the food slides out extremely easily ;-) but as far as frying itself is concerned it is wonderful. Just use oil directly from the bottle instead of with an oil spray (as the directions say), use low or maximum a medium high flame, make certain the oil is distributed over the whole pan, and voila, no problems with food sticking to the pan. I'm going to buy another one soon - maybe the small one again, after all! Read more Helpful Report Jem Shaw 5.0 out of 5 stars Lovely, hefty pans that feel like quality Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2020 Style Name: Cookware Set Size Name: 3 Piece Frying Pan Set Verified Purchase Having watched "Dark Waters" on Amazon Prime (also higjly recommended), I wanted our toxic, 10 year old Teflon pans out of the house as soon as possible. These looked like a good balance of quality and price. Having received them I can say the scales weigh heavily on the quality side. The ceramic coating is silky smooth and efficiently nonstick. Handles are firmly fixed and pleasantly ergonomic, and the bases are hefty and solid. I usually shy away from aluminium cookware in view of the link to Alzheimer's, but there's no danger of contamination here, thanks to what feels like a thick and robust ceramic coating. Aluminium can also give uneven heating, but these have thicker, flattened bases that give excellent heat distribution. We were impressed enough to immefiately order a 30cm GreenPan to complete the set.

I would say they are very easy to clean, delivery and packing all excellent. The pans are wonderful to use however not as sturdy feeling as my 15 year old now worn out Circulon Anodised set. I feel they were expensive but no more so than any of the high quality sets on offer now days. I expect them to last and last many years and hope they do, but only time will tell. Hence, why I can only give them a 4* rating. Read more Helpful Report Natasha Roche 2.0 out of 5 stars Non stick layer gone within four months. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2021 Style Name: Frying Pan Size Name: 30 cm Verified Purchase First time purchasing a ceramic non-stick pan. Was eager to switch from Teflon coated pans, given that they only last a year or two at most before the non-stick coating is scratched off and basically unusable. Seemed like a fantastic purchase the first couple of months but gradually the middle of the pan started to have more of a matte finish and this got worse as time went on, covering the whole middle area. This matte area is like cooking on bare steel, and if I'm not cooking something up with a sauce I have to use a vinegar to lift off whatever's been left behind. The ceramic coating is probably great for saucepans as they see a lot less hard work in the kitchen but for a frying pan it can't cut it unfortunately.
