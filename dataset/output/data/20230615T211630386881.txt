We are also required to keep a record of the checks We have made.

To comply with the Regulations, We use an ID verification process operated by a third party, Lifetime Legal. You will need to complete their process which will include providing personal information. Lifetime Legal will search several different databases including credit reference bureaux’s, the electoral roll and HM Land Registry where relevant. These checks will leave a record of the search within Your credit file, but will not affect your credit rating in any way. Occasionally, additional information or documentation may be requested to support the process. This is likely to be a Council Tax bill, bank statement or utility bill dated within the last 3 months. There is a non-refundable charge of £36 including VAT. This does not increase if there is more than one individual selling. This will be collected in advance by Lifetime Legal as a single payment.
