We were given clear, useful recommendations that we used to draft the ad and it was live within 24 hours. This prompted a number of phone calls and viewings almost instantly, and the property was let within 3 days of the listing. We wouldn’t hesitate to use Rightmove Commercial again in the future.” Libby Price Director – B Price Ltd “I really appreciate the best practice marketing advice I get from the Rightmove team around creating great listings. I’ve implemented that I’m seeing some great results. I use the auto-responder on Rightmove to make sure our short property videos get sent straight away, even if an enquiry comes in at 11pm.
