Contact the team at your local Savills office or use our residential stamp duty calculator for more information. How much stamp duty will I pay on my non-residential property purchase? In order to calculate stamp duty when purchasing commercial properties, you need to input the value of the property you would like to buy into the Commercial Stamp Duty calculator above. Once done, press ‘calculate’. Please note that this calculation is only to be viewed as an indicator. The actual amount of commercial stamp duty you must pay on completion will be advised by your tax consultant or legal representative. Frequently asked questions How much is commercial stamp duty? Commercial Stamp Duty property rates are currently based on the individual purchase amounts of non-residential properties, as well as mixed use properties. Use the commercial stamp duty calculator at the top of the page, in order to get an idea of how much stamp duty you need to pay. What classifies as a commercial property? When calculating commercial stamp duty, non-residential properties which are classified as commercial include: Offices Forestry Warehouses Sheds Factories Retail units Agricultural land Fisheries Mixed use spaces, such as flats above shops Residential property containing a certain number of units Are commercial stamp duty and residential stamp duty the same? Commercial stamp duty is different to that charged on residential properties. Headline rates for Stamp Duty on commercial properties are lower than those for residential properties. Commercial land purchases and transfers are also included as part of the costs surrounding commercial stamp duty. As with residential properties in Scotland and Wales, instead of Commercial SDLT, the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and the Land Transaction Tax need to be paid respectively. How long do you have to pay stamp duty on a commercial property? Commercial property stamp duty must be paid within 30 days from the date of completion. Your legal advisor should pay this for you to make sure you do not miss the deadline and possibly incur a fine. Your solicitor, agent or conveyancer can file your return and pay Stamp Duty for you and add the amount to their fees. If you are eligible for any stamp duty relief, such as that afforded to first-time buyers, they can also claim this for you. Are you entitled to relief in regards to commercial stamp duty? If you are purchasing a commercial property within a designated Investment Zone or Freeport tax area, you can be entitled to commercial SDLT relief. This is if you intend to use the building you are purchasing for: A commercial trade or profession Development and redevelopment for resale Letting the buildings or land to another individual for commercial use, not residential use You must submit a land transaction return within 14 days of the property purchase, in order to claim the commercial SDLT relief. What are the current rates for freehold commercial stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland? Freehold Commercial Stamp Duty rates are based upon property prices paid. SDLT is charged on the price paid for the property including VAT. No stamp duty is payable on a commercial property where the price paid is below £150,000. What are the current rates for leasehold commercial stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland? Leasehold Commercial Stamp Duty is slightly different from freehold commercial SDLT. You pay the Stamp Duty based on the lease premium (purchase price of the lease) and the net present value (the annual rent value you’ll pay). The price of a leasehold SDLT can also be affected by the length of the lease too. What are the current non-residential property rates for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in Scotland? The rates for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax differ from those for stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland. Again, the applicable percentage rates are based upon the price paid for the property property within set bands. What are the current non-residential property lease transaction rates for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in Scotland? Land and Buildings Transaction Tax for renting or leasing a non-residential property, are very similar to leasehold commercial stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland, but the NPV threshold amounts are slightly different. Plus, if the average rent is at least £1,000 per annum the nil rate tax band does not apply in relation to the premium.
