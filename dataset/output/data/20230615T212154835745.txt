Functional Active Inactive Analytical Active Inactive Non-essential Active Inactive Manage Accept Home Rent Tenant guides During the tenancy During the tenancy Tenant guides First time renting guide Tips for viewing a rental property Moving into rental property During the tenancy Moving out of a rental property Damp, mould and condensation Maintenance tips for your rental property What to do if there is an emergency in your rental property Preventing rental fraud During the tenancy Our helpful guide gives an overview of responsibilities during the tenancy and provides details of what to do in a range of situations which might arise. Who can occupy the property Landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that every adult occupant over the age of 18 has the right to rent a property in England. We conduct initial Right to Rent checks before the tenancy starts and will contact you if there is any need for future checks, depending on your nationality and your Visa. You may not transfer your tenancy to another person and it is very important that guests over the age of 18 who are not on the tenancy agreement are not permitted to occupy the property. If one of the named tenants wishes to leave, regardless of whether they are to be replaced, please contact us immediately so we can discuss this with your landlord and make the necessary arrangements. Maintaining the property Tenants are responsible for normal household maintenance including: Replacing light bulbs & fuses Cleaning windows Cutting lawns and maintaining hedges/borders Keeping all guttering and drains clear from leaves and blockages Removal of pests such as fleas, ants, wasps etc. Any other tasks that are considered normal household management. Ventilation of the property is also a necessity, to alleviate condensation. Any condensation within the property is the tenantâ€™s responsibility. Garden maintenance If there is a garden with your property, you must keep it in good order. You must not uproot established trees or shrubs, and you must not remove existing lawns already laid when your tenancy starts. Repairs and maintenance If you should experience any problems with either the contents (owned by the landlord) or structure of the property, please report this to the Property Management team immediately to request an approved contractor to investigate the problem. For more costly repairs, it may be necessary for your landlord to obtain more than one quotation from contractors, or to instruct a surveyor to assess the nature of the problem so that it can be resolved effectively. This will require your assistance so that we can gain access for quotes and we may ask a contractor to call you to arrange access. If you would prefer to be present when a contractor visits you can then book an appointment which suits you. However, if you then cannot attend, please liaise with them to rearrange or they may charge you for their failed visit. You should not to instruct a contractor directly, except in the event of a genuine emergency (an emergency is maintenance matters that pose a threat to health and safety). We offer this advice as the Landlord may not agree with any work undertaken and the liability for paying the invoice may fall to you. Smoke and Carbon Monoxide (CO) Alarms All rented properties must have smoke alarms fitted on each floor of the living accommodation and CO alarms in any room where there is a solid fuel burning appliance (wood, coal etc.) During your tenancy it is your responsibility to periodically test and replace any batteries within the Smoke or CO alarms. We recommend you test them monthly as a minimum to ensure that they are in working order. If you find an alarm is not working, and changing the batteries does not rectify this, you should notify us immediately so that we can arrange a replacement. Gas appliances By law, your landlord must have all gas systems, appliances and flues tested and checked at least every 12 months by a Gas Safe registered engineer. These regulations do not apply to appliances owned by tenants, for example a gas cooker. Youâ€™ll have received a copy of the Gas Safety certificate in your move-in pack and we will contact you to arrange an appointment when this is due for renewal. It is in the interests of your own safety and welfare that you co-operate fully with contractors making appointments with you to carry out gas safety inspections. For your own safety we would recommend you have any gas appliances of your own tested once every twelve months. We can supply details of a gas engineer upon request. You will be provided with a copy of the gas safety certificate by the Gas Safe engineer upon completion of the visit. Changes to the property Your landlord wants you to feel at home in the property but remember that the landlord must give their consent prior to any redecoration or alterations. Not complying with this could result in you being charged for the cost of returning the property to its original condition at the end of the tenancy. Lost keys and fobs We know how stressful it can be when you lose your keys, so if this happens, please contact Property Management. If we have another set you will be able to collect them from the office (remember to bring appropriate ID!) to have a set cut at your own cost. If a lock change is required as a result of lost keys we may need to call a locksmith at your cost. Unfortunately you will also need to replace any keys that your landlord holds, so that they can access the property. For properties in a block with communal entrance doors, you may will also need to arrange a replacement keys for you and all other residents in the block. Landlords will not accept liability for the loss of keys by a tenant. Break-ins / vandalism We hope that you will never experience a break-in. However, should this happen during your tenancy please take the following steps: Report the incident to the police and be sure to obtain a crime reference number. It is important that the police are informed and a Crime Reference number obtained otherwise this may prevent you or your landlord from making an insurance claim. Contact your Property Manager if there is any damage to windows or external doors so that we can arrange for a contractor to secure the property. Broken glass and windows With anything dangerous like broken glass, please ensure that you report this to us immediately. It is the responsibility of a tenant to repair any windows or glazing broken at the property during the tenancy both internally and externally with like-for-like glass. Renewal and rent reviews Around two months prior to the end of your fixed term we will contact you to discuss your future plans. The process is similar to the start of the original tenancy and allows further commitment, planning and budgeting for another fixed term. Your Landlord reserves the right to review the rent at this point and may decide to seek an increase, which will be detailed in any renewal paperwork.
