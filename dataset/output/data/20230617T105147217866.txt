What's Hot PaulButt Frets: 45 January 2022 edited January 2022 in Guitar So I've just picked up a lovely 14ish year old 'Stigg' built Les Paul 58 replica. Its a gold top which, I believe, is pretty unusual. I wondered if there were any other 'Stigg' owners out there who might like to share your experiences with me. This is my first replica guitar and, to me, the build quality and overall feel of the guitar is incredible. I must admit though, parting with so much cash, for a non Gibson Gibson, left me a little shaky. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/07b8ndsvxs3qk12/AAD1p_Pr5s0gfH3N8CQZy53Ta?dl=0 0 LOL 0 Wow! 1 Wisdom « 1 2 3 » Comments bertie Frets: 11779 January 2022 edited January 2022 heard of Stagg but not Stigg, Im assuming they're a luthier ?

Have heard of Stagg, an SE Asian copy brand that has been going for decades. Now, insert your own joke about a racing car driver who likes to remain anonymous. Presumably, these guitars are only available in white. Be seeing you. 0 LOL 0 Wow! 0 Wisdom RiftAmps Frets: 2898 January 2022 tFB Trader 'Stig' LPs are very well thought of and usually quite desired. I seem to recall them being mentioned in the same breath as Bartlett etc. I think they were all commissioned by Gary Winterflood based on his own '59? The builder remained anonymous (hence The Stig aka Top Gear) but that's as much as I know *I no longer offer replacement speaker baffles* Rift Amplification Handwired Guitar Amplifiers Brackley, Northamptonshire www.riftamps.co.uk 0 LOL 0 Wow! 1 Wisdom designerseye88 Frets: 920 January 2022 Played a few about 2 years ago now. Nice guitars, seem well made but I went with a different builder who had more of a following.

Any attempt to sell it through the forum, with or without pictures of the headstock, will result in an instant ban.

Thanks. 0 LOL 0 Wow! 0 Wisdom MGTonewood Frets: 4 January 2022 I was fortunate enough to start buying ‘Bursts in the 70’s so I have owned quite a few and kept the two I liked most, right up until 2015. That was after I purchased my third STIGG guitar, my second Les Paul from Guitar Avenue. I now own two beautiful STIGG flametop LP standards and an incredible, beautifully figured blonde STIGG 335. All of these are fitted with original long -magnet PAFs, original looms, ABR-1s and long studs. (in other words the bits that make a difference to the sound). My two Les Pauls sound as good as any original PAF Les Paul (Gold or Sunburst) and as musical instruments the STIGGs play much better. Trust me I really have played an awful lot of originals especially through the best years of US guitar shows! My 335 is also out there on its own…... BETTER than any Gibson “dotneck” I’ve owned or played and I’ve played a few of those too! Most people who have played mine have turned to me and said “it’s probably the best guitar they’ve ever played”. So it’s no secret I’m a big fan and will never sell my STIGGS, they’re mine for life so it doesn’t matter that they cost more than most “Historics” - in any case why should I worry? I sold my originals and put £420,000 in the bank - PERFECT! If you can find one check it out, there are no bad STIGGs……. they’re ALL great guitars. 0 LOL 3 Wow! 1 Wisdom Danielsguitars Frets: 2928 January 2022 tFB Trader I've only seen one stigg a few years ago it was at the kempton guitar show, i think it was being punted out by Gary winterflood, I think I heard prices were around £20k which is nuts, not that I buy anything so it doesn't matter. Looked like a nice lp that's all I remember. www.danielsguitars.co.uk (formerly customkits) 0 LOL 0 Wow! 0 Wisdom Rockhard Frets: 127 January 2022 PaulButt said: So I've just picked up a lovely 14ish year old 'Stigg' built Les Paul 58 replica.
