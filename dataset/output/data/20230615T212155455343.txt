Criminals place fake adverts with properties to let (stealing photos and property details from unsuspecting private landlords or letting agents) or respond to online requests for rental properties (which often appear on social media). To prevent Rental Fraud tenants should research any letting agency, landlord or property before handing over any money – using the internet, review sites or phoning contacts using publically available contact details. Posting a request for rental properties online is not recommended. Remember, at JNP, we never ask for payment via social media or for customers to share information from payment cards. We have strict processes for this sort of transaction which only operate via colleagues in our branches. If you are unsure whether any contact from us is genuine, please contact your local branch , yourself, by phone and speak to one of the team. It’s important to remain vigilant to prevent being a victim of fraud. For more information, be sure to visit the Action Fraud website.
