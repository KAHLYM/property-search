B: Suppose we meet in the offices downstairs at four o’clock? A: That’s perfect. I’ll let the others know . Supposing I don’t bring my car and you and I travel together. That would save us half the cost of petrol and parking. A: The electricity has gone. There must be a power cut . B: What if we find the candles and put them around the room? A: Okay. Good idea. Do you know where they are? Possibility When we are less certain, we use suppose, supposing and what if + past form to talk about future possibility : Suppose we asked Mary to baby-sit? Do you think she’d do it? (not as certain as Suppose we ask Mary to baby-sit? ) Supposing someone else wrote the essay. How would we know? (not as certain as Supposing someone else writes the essay … ) A: What if I gave up working full-time. I’d love that . B: You’re joking surely!! When we refer to something that did not happen (something hypothetical), we use the past perfect: Suppose we hadn’t brought our umbrellas. (We did bring our umbrellas.) Supposing they had closed the road. Would that have been a good idea? (They didn’t close the road.) What if I had accidentally told Maria about the party! That would have ruined the surprise.
