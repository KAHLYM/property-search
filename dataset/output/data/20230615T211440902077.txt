Try our commercial stamp duty calculator or contact our team for more information. When did the Stamp Duty rates change? The Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced new residential Stamp Duty rates in an announcement on 23 September 2022. The new rates came in with immediate effect and are reflected within our calculator tool above, and the information below. How much Stamp duty will I pay? To calculate the SDLT that may be payable on your planned property purchase, simply put the purchase price of your home into our stamp duty calculator above and click 'calculate'. It is important to note that this is an indicator only, your solicitor or tax consultant will advise you as to the actual amount of residential stamp duty that must be paid on completion of buying your new home. Frequently asked questions - What is Stamp Duty? Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is paid when you purchase property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. Stamp Duty applies when you buy a freehold property, buy a new or existing leasehold, buy property through a shared ownership scheme or are transferred property in exchange for payment. SDLT differs when purchasing property in Scotland and Wales. When purchasing property in Scotland you instead pay Land and Buildings Transaction Tax , whilst in Wales, SDLT was replaced by Land Transaction Tax from 1 April 2018. Who pays Stamp Duty? Stamp Duty applies on home purchases over a price threshold. Currently, the threshold for residential properties is £250,000 First-time property buyers get a discount (relief) meaning they pay less or no tax if the following apply: you, and anyone else you’re buying with, are first-time buyers the purchase price of your home is £625,000 or less How much is Stamp Duty? The amount of stamp duty you pay is dependent on whether you are purchasing a residential, non-residential or mixed use property. For a residential property purchase there are different rates of Stamp Duty if you are a first-time buyer or are purchasing a second/additional property. To work out how much Stamp Duty Land Tax you will have to pay, use the Stamp Duty Calculator above. When do you pay Stamp Duty? Once you have completed your property or land purchase, homeowners have 14 days to send a Stamp Duty return to HMRC and pay the tax. Your solicitor, agent or conveyancer can file your return and pay SDLT for you and add the amount to their fees. If you are eligible for any residential stamp duty relief, such as that afforded to first-time buyers, they can also claim this for you. What are the current stamp duty rates? Following the changes to Stamp Duty announced by the Chancellor on 23 September 2022, Stamp Duty is now levied on the amount that you pay for a residential property above £250,000. What are the higher rates of stamp duty for additional properties? The 3% higher rate of SDLT for purchases of additional dwellings, such as second homes or buy-to-let properties, is applied on top of the rates set out in the table above. How much Stamp duty do First Time Buyers pay? Following the Chancellor's announcement on 23 September 2022, first time buyers pay 0% SDLT on the value of a property under £425,000 and 5% Stamp Duty on the value of the property between £425,000 and £625,000. Properties purchased with a value over £625,000 will not benefit from any first time buyer relief and standard rates will apply on the full value of the property. New Stamp Duty rates for non-UK residents from 1st April 2021 In July 2020 the UK Government announced draft measures for new rates of Stamp Duty for purchasers of residential property in England and Northern Ireland who are not resident in the United Kingdom. The new rates are 2 percentage points higher than those that apply to purchases made by UK residents, and apply to purchases of both freehold and leasehold property as well as increasing SDLT payable on rents on the grant of a new lease. The surcharge will be applied in addition to the 3% surcharge currently levied on second/additional home or buy-to-let purchases. Notes These rates do not apply to the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) applicable in Scotland since April 2015, please use our LBTT calculator for transactions in Scotland. The Stamp Duty Indicator also presumes that none (or part) of the property qualifies as mixed-use for which the current SDLT would be up to 5%. Importantly, you cannot use the tool for residential properties with chargeable consideration over £500,000 where the 15% rate of SDLT applies. You’ll need to perform a manual calculation instead; your solicitor or tax consultant will be able to advise.
