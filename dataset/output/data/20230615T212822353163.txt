A high amenity area, the property is well located for access to a wide range of excellent private schools, the financial district and all cultural and sporting amenities around the city. Innerwick House is a beautifully presented and well appointed stone built Georgian home, sympathetically extended in Edwardian times to provide superb family accommodation set over two principal floors. The property was comprehensively refurbished and reconfigured in the late 1990's by the acclaimed Lorn Macneal Architects to create free-flowing family living and reception space on the ground floor, complemented by 5 generous double bedrooms and 5 bathrooms making this an exceptional family home. Of particular note are the original period features, the elegant drawing and dining rooms and the wonderful open plan dining kitchen and family living room. There is an extensive cellar below providing useful storage space. The house is approached by a drive-in, drive-out gravelled driveway providing ample parking as well as access to a car port. A colourful front garden is well screened by a number of mature trees, while to the rear of the house there is a paved stone terrace and a sizeable lawn with beautifully landscaped borders surrounding. To the west side of the garden there is a delightful water feature with a summer house, and to the rear of the garden there is a gardener’s pavilion with wood panelled Den above. The Old Coach House is set to the northern boundary and has courtyard parking in front. The property has been successfully let on short-term holiday lets providing a substantial income, with the accommodation including hall, breakfasting kitchen with utility room off, office/bedroom 3, shower room and open plan dining room and drawing room with Minstrel’s gallery above. Upstairs, there are 2 bedrooms and an en suite bathroom. To the rear of The Coach House there is a paved garden. Tenure - Freehold Council Tax - H EPC - F Viewing strictly by appointment only.
